# Easterbrook-Training
Easterbrook Language Services Website
This site has been an ongoing project of mine for over 15 years.
It started of as a collection of HTML image pages with a border which I then mutated into a Photoshop site which was sliced up and rendered with Dreamweaver.
Today it's a one page HTML site using Boostrap 4 and other CSS techniques which I implement to create a unique interface.
I've incorporated a strong emphasis is on interactivity as I believe it's a vital component of a successful website.
